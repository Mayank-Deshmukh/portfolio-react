This is a personal portfolio website built using the React framework. It's designed to showcase your skills, projects, and achievements to potential employers or clients. This README file will guide you through the setup and customization of this portfolio website.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the portfolio website locally for development.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (at least version 14)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-website.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd portfolio-website
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server, and your portfolio website will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Customization

You can customize this portfolio website to make it your own. Here are some ways to do that:

### Adding Your Content

1. Open the `src/data/data.js` file and update the content to reflect your personal information, skills, projects, and experiences. Modify the `data` object with your data.

2. Replace the placeholder images in the `public/images` directory with your own project screenshots and profile picture. Make sure to keep the file names consistent with the data in `src/data/data.js`.

### Styling

You can customize the styles of the website by modifying the CSS files in the `src/styles` directory. You can also add your own CSS files or use a CSS preprocessor like SASS if you prefer.

## Deployment

To deploy your portfolio website to a hosting service, you can build the production version of the website using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` directory with optimized assets and a production-ready build of your website. You can then upload the contents of the `build` directory to your hosting provider of choice.
